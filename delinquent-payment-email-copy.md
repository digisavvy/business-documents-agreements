Dear [Client Name],

I hope you have are enjoying a productive week.

I noticed that your invoice is overdue by more than [Number of Days] days and wanted to reach out to make sure that you received our original invoice(s) [Invoice Number(s)] and my reminder email on [Date].

I'm concerned that you may not be aware that your invoice is more than [25] days overdue to reach out to you immediately before a late fee of X% is added to your outstanding balance.

I have included it here just in case you hadn't received it or misplaced.

Could you please reply to me via email or call me directly at [Your Phone Number] by the end of the day and let me know you received this?

As a reminder we do take payment by CC or with a check.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the service we provided you, or on your outstanding balance please call me personally so that I can make sure that we can discuss and resolve any potential issues quickly.

As always we are grateful for your support and loyalty.

Warm Regards,
